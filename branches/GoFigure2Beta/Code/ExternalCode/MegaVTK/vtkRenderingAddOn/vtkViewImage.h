   \class vtkViewImage
   \brief This class is a top-level convenience class for displaying a scalar - or RGB
   image in a 2D or 3D scene.

   It inherits from the vtkImageViewer2 class, which is initially designed for 2D scene
   visualization. However, vtkViewImage overrides some of its parents' methods (SetSlice())
   in order to generalize its purpose to 2D AND 3D scene visualization.

   As a high-level class, it provides the user with convinient functionalities
   such as a colormap (SetLookupTable()), a scalar bar (ScalarBarActor), some corner annotations
   (CornerAnnotation), access to the background color (SetBackground()), the
   annotation text properties (SetTextProperty()), or a call for reseting to default values
   (Reset() or ResetCamera()).


   The principle add-on of this class is to tacke the common issue of placing
   different objects in a same consistent reference frame. In a world coordinates system, an
   volume image can be localized by its origin and its spacing, and an orientation vector defining
   how to rotate the volume to be consistent with reality.

   The vtkImageData class has among its attributes the origin and the spacing information.
   However, the orientation information is missing.

   The vtkViewImage class tackle this lack by providing the user the possibility to set an
   orientation matrix with SetOrientationMatrix(). This matrix will directly be applied to the
   actor describing the image in the 2D - or 3D - scene. The rotation 3x3 component of this matrix
   has to be orthogonal (no scaling). The offset component may contain the origin information.
   In this case the user will have to make sure that this information is absent from the vtkImageData
   instance given in SetInput(). For that you can call : view->GetInput()->SetOrigin(0,0,0).

     apply to the image bouding box (axis aligned) to the world coordinate
     system.

     Rotation part is usually given by the GetDirection() method on an itk::Image
     for instance. Translation usually correspond to the origin of the image
     given by GetOrigin() on an itk::Image.

     CAUTION: if you provide non-zero origin to the viewer vtkImageData input
     (SetInput()), then don't provide translation to the OrientationMatrix
     instance, otherwise the information is redundant.

     The best behaviour is to force the origin of the vtkImageData input to zero
     and provide this origin information in the OrientationMatrix.
