/**
  \class vtkViewImage
  \ingroup MegaVTK
  \brief This class is a top-level convenience class for displaying a
  scalar - or RGB image in a 2D or 3D scene.

  It inherits from the vtkImageViewer2 class, which is initially designed
  for 2D scene visualization. However, vtkViewImage overrides some of its
  parents' methods (SetSlice()) in order to generalize its purpose to 2D
  AND 3D scene visualization.

  As a high-level class, it provides the user with convinient
  functionalities such as a colormap (SetLookupTable()), a scalar bar
  (ScalarBarActor), some corner annotations (CornerAnnotation), access to
  the background color (SetBackground()), the annotation text properties
  (SetTextProperty()), or a call for reseting to default values (Reset() or
  ResetCamera()).


  The principle add-on of this class is to tacke the common issue of placing
  different objects in a same consistent reference frame. In a world
  coordinates system, an volume image can be localized by its origin and
  its spacing, and an orientation vector defining how to rotate the volume
  to be consistent with reality.

  The vtkImageData class has among its attributes the origin and the
  spacing information. However, the orientation information is missing.

  The vtkViewImage class tackle this lack by providing the user the
  possibility to set an orientation matrix with SetOrientationMatrix().
  This matrix will directly be applied to the actor describing the image
  in the 2D - or 3D - scene. The rotation 3x3 component of this matrix has
  to be orthogonal (no scaling). The offset component may contain the
  origin information.
  In this case the user will have to make sure that this information is
  absent from the vtkImageData instance given in SetInput(). For that you
  can call : view->GetInput()->SetOrigin(0,0,0).
