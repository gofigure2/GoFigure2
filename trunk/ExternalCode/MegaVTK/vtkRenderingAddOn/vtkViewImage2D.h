     Description:
     The orientation of the view is a abstract representation of the object
     we are looking at. It results from the acquisition plane. Setting the View
     Orientation by calling SetViewOrientation() will imply the view to set its
     inner "slice" orientation. (slice orientation == 2 means plane of
     acquisition.)

     IMPORTANT NOTE:

     The view orientations defined here are orthogonal to the normal basis
     in the scanner. A very interesting improvement would be to define "oblique"
     view orientations for cardiac imaging, something like:

     VIEW_ORIENTATION_SHORT_AXIS, VIEW_ORIENTATION_LONG_AXIS, and
     VIEW_ORIENTATION_FOUR_CHAMBER could define the different views that are
     usually used in cardiac imaging.

     From this user-input information, the idea would be to evaluate which slice
     orientation does correspond to the requested view. This can be done by
     evaluating the dot product between the axis of acquisition and a
     pre-defined oblique axis that "should" correspond to the requested
     orientation...
